Some of the functionality of these dotfiles depends on formulae installed by `brew.sh`. If you donâ€™t plan to run `brew.sh`, you should look carefully through the script and manually install any particularly important ones. A good example is Bash/Git completion: the dotfiles use a special version from Homebrew.
